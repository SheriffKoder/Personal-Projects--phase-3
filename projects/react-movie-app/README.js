API.js: functions that will handle the api calls to the movie database api
(in the previous course)

config.js: everything that should be setup with the database api
helpers.js: function to convert numbers-to-money/time


//create a .env file in the project root
react has built in support for env variables
but have to name them REACT_NAME
env is not the safest way to store variables, as the keys can still be visible on the client browser ?

app.js is the heart of our application
index.js is the start of our application

React.StrictMode, do checks if did some things when writing your application

JSX, javascript xml

use state in a parent component, if you want to use that state
in multiple child components

should never change the prop value in the child component that inherits the props
only change from the parent/source
but can change the state with a setter in the child component

html element text
{switchOnProp ? "On" : "Off"}




whats new ?
- createElement instead of returning JSX directly
- styled components
