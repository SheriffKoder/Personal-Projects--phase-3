Web Accessibility in the design stage

presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure
Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content

Visual:
- captions
- text size adjustments, can be adjusted with web browser's controls
    - some users change size, spacing, font, color, and other text properties
- signs
- large clickable areas, with enough space between them


- using the website in bright, glare, low light environments
- sufficient contrast between foreground/text and background color combinations
    3:1 color contrast minimum
    Level AA (minimum) requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
    Level AAA (enhanced) requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

    Check My Colors (checkmycolours.com)
    Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analyser (juicystudio.com)
    Chrome>element picker>element's accessibility contrast ratio

- support the use of custom color combinations
- high contrast and also use theme for people sensitive to brightness


- bright color sensitivity, color blindness
- compatible to not sharp sighted, tunnel vision, clouded vision users
- colors to convey information (green, yellow, red etc)


- visual animations not induce migraines, 
- options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing etc.


Usage:
- usable to non tech savvy users, new users, users in a hurry
- use duration
- concepts should be simple, easy on memory, not induce anxiety
- slow bandwidth
- slow interacting users, enough time to complete tasks
- keyboard usage full support (tab key navigation)
- indicators of current focus, mechanisms to skip over blocks
- provide understandable notifications, confirmations and feedback when actions are completed



////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Form:
- clearly structured content for better orientation
- Content and functionality is easier to locate and identify by most users.
- labeling of forms, buttons etc.
- simple text that is supplemented by images, graphs and other illustrations
- simple syntax, short sentences
- layout is clear, easy to understand and use
- adaptable to smaller and larger screen sizes
- Applications should use the operating system and web browser text settings
- provide headers to identify groups of information
- Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions.
- focus styles, scale, outline, border width, opacity
- html tab order preserved along with css

Forms:
- use <label> with inputs, with (required) etc
- group inputs with fieldsets and legends
- use * for required fields in forms
- not rely only on js for validation
- Error alert, then focus
- error correction options for forms
    informing what caused the error and how to fix it
    Error: 'JohnSmith@@test.com' is not valid. Example of a valid email: example@yourdomain.com.
- top of form errors + inline errors
- aria-invalid="true" //invalid form inputs
- Use fieldsets and legends to associate groups of checkboxes and radio buttons.
- Allow resubmission and revalidation of the form information.



Navigation
- predictable link targets, functionality, overall interaction
- different ways of navigating, hierarchial menu and search
- simple navigation mechanisms
- easy to locate and identify


Structure (ensure that text information is understandable without the visual context)
- headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, and tables
- nav, main, starting with h1, 
- Provide text alternatives for images, icons, and other non-text content
    empty alternatives if 
        - the image not convey a meaning or decorative (better use decorative in css generic div backgrounds)
        - meaning is in the surrounding text
    alternatives: accurate, concise, not repeated in page, not include word "image of" etc.

- links
    - capitalize if wanted, but with css
    - not use link or click
    - use sr-only class and aria-hidden
    - for emotions <span class="sr-only">Smiley face</span> <span aria-hidden="true">:-)</span>
    - not use much links in page
    - use a contrast ratio of 3:1 on link focus
    - use css :focus with css :hover
    - the use of ONCLICK on random elements, such as SPAN, IMG and DIV is not permitted.
    - link text describes where it redirects to briefly - with size/type for downloads - or will open in a new tab of target="_blank"


Text
- meaningful text not relying on surrounding context
- do not try to fix how the words are announced by changing their letters


<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google 
 <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>
 <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-edit fa-external-link"></i>
</a>

.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  border: 0;
}




////////////WAI-ARIA
is used to add in any missing semantics or functionality.
- use native HTML elements and attributes over ARIA when possible
- all interactive ARIA controls must be usable with a keyboard.
- never change native semantics, unless you have no other choice.
- never use role='presentation' or aria-hidden='true' on focusable elements.
- interactive elements must have an accessible name.


//aria-hidden='true'
html attribute, removes element and its children from accessibility tree 
if the item is focusable, it would do nothing


<button type='button' aria-label='Close menu'>X</button>
a screen reader would announce, “Close menu, button”. instead of X

<nav aria-label='main navigation'>...</nav>
useful if have many navigations on the page
it would announce “Main navigation, navigation landmark”
it would announce Sub navigation, navigation landmark” etc.


////aria labelled-by
//labelling element, wont give focus to button
//can be hidden with html/css to be used also and not seen by users
<h2 id='label'>Shirts</h2>

//And here's the labelled element. Note the order of the ID references passed in
<button type='button' id='shop-btn' aria-labelledby='label shop-btn'>Shop Now</button>
//would be announced by a screen reader as, “Shirts, shop now, button”. 


////aria-describedby (same as labeled by)

<label>Password:
  <input type='password' aria-describedby='password-requirements' />
</label>
<span id='password-requirements'>Password must be at least 10 characters long.</span>





name: 
announced to the user
what separates elements of the same type from one another

description:
announced in addition to name








//HTML: div and span aren't focusable but we can make them so
The `tabindex` attribute makes the `<div>` elements focusable
    <div class='button-container'>
        <div class='rock button' tabindex='0'>Rock</div>
        <div class='paper button' tabindex='0'>Paper</div>
        <div class='scissors button' tabindex='0'>Scissors</div>
      </div>
      
//JS: We also need to manually add in event handling for both mouse and keyboard events.
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.button');

function nameAlerter(e) {
if (e.type === 'click' || e.key === ' ' || e.key === 'Enter') {
    alert(e.target.textContent);
    }
}

buttons.forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener('click', nameAlerter)
    button.addEventListener('keydown', nameAlerter)
})
      
      

<button>
using the <button> element provide the context screen reader users need
focusable and have event handling for keyboards by default
default: pressing the “space” or “enter” keys on a keyboard when a <button> 
has focus will trigger the “click” event.



*:focus {
  outline: xxx;
  border: xxx;
}




- for hiding content use display: none or visibility: hidden
- tabindex property makes sure item is focusable, keep to 0 for keeping the html order and not bounce around
- tab index -1 makes un-focusable

//focus:
tab (focus forward)
shift tab (focus back)
up/down, type first letter to access dropdown
not all elements are focusable

//heavy navigation skip link: 
provide a link at the top of the page that, that is hidden from the page
but when activated, jumps the user to the beginning of the main content area.
animate when focused to the page again using transitions

hidden by: 
.sr-only {  //screen reader only
position:absolute;  //remove from text flow
left:-10000px;
top:auto;   //same vertical place
width:1px;
height:1px;
overflow:hidden; //hide everything that does not fit into the 1px x 1px
}

#skip a:focus
{
position:static;
width:auto;
height:auto;
}



<body>
<a href="#maincontent">Skip to main content</a>
...
<main id="maincontent">
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>This is the first paragraph</p>

Accessibility Auditing

axe DevTools for Chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US


Lighthouse for Chrome 
is available in the Chrome DevTools by default
provides more than just a11y auditing, including performance, best practices, 
    search engine optimization (SEO), and progressive web app (PWA) if applicable. 
and like the axe DevTools there may be a list of issues for you to manually check.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/


WebAIM’s WAVE 
a website based tool where you enter the URL of the page you want to audit, 
though there are also browser extension and API options. WAVE will return a preview 
of the page with an overlay of icons on it, and issues are separated into categories 
of alerts, warnings, and contrast errors. Unfortunately the icons that are placed 
on the page may cause the layout to break, but that could be a minor issue 
if you’re more focused on the a11y issues that are found




//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Chrome accessibility pane 
is where you can view the accessibility tree, ARIA attributes, 
and computed accessibility properties of DOM nodes.

able to see single node as well as explore the whole acc tree
will ask you to reload devtools, and click on the person icon
to switch to accessibility tree view button

This is a great way to understand the mapping between the DOM node and its 
accessibility tree node.



The elements on the page don't always appear in the order they are in the source. 
This might confuse users who depend on assistive technology to navigate the web.

To view and debug the source order on your website:

Inspect an element on the page.
In Elements > Accessibility > Source Order Viewer, check Checkbox. Show source order.

In the viewport, DevTools outlines nested elements with borders and marks them 
with numbers corresponding to their source order.

Some accessibility properties are dynamically calculated by the browser. 
These properties can be viewed in the Computed Properties section of the 
Accessibility pane.


fix contrast in Chrome dev tools:
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/contrast/

the rendering tab also has 
emulate-vision-deficiencies
to check your website by Emulating blurred vision for example

Chrome dev tools accessibility improvement recommendations

Click the Open Issues button next to Settings. Settings in the right corner 
of the action bar at the top. Depending on issue severity, the button can 
have a red Error., yellow Warning., or blue Information. icon.

Alternatively, select Issues from the More tools menu. More tools menu.

Once you're on the Issues tab, you might want to reload the page to catch 
even more issues, this time occurring during page load.

The Issues tab counts the number of affected resources for each issue and shows 
it next to their headlines. Additionally, you can organize the issues by their 
severity in three group kinds:

Note: This is a preview feature disabled by default. To enable it, check Settings. 
Settings > Experiments > Checkbox. Allow grouping and hiding of issues by issue 
kind.

To group issues, check Checkbox. Group by kind in the action bar at the top of 
the Issues tab.

when using div or span, ask.. 
is there a more appropriate element to use in the current situation ?

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Lower end target: 320px
- Higher end target: setting up a max-width for all of your content and then 
centering that on the page. 

common breakpoints for widths of devices:

320px — 480px: Mobile devices
481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets
769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops
1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens
1201px and more —  Extra large screens, TV


////media queries
Important: Always put your media queries at the end of your CSS file.


//zooming in will use the smaller media query
media types: all, print, screen, speech (SR)
prefers-reduced-motion
logical operators: not, only, and, (or, ,)

body {
  margin: 24px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) { //any resolution below the given style
  body {
    margin: 8px;
  }
}


@media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {
@media (width <= 30em) {
@media only screen and (color) {
@media print {
@media (not (screen and (color))), print and (color) {
    
//might test for a width between two values like so:
@media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) {
@media (30em <= width <= 50em) {

//devices with no hover capability
@media (not(hover)) {


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1) add the viewport meta tag in html head
sets the initial width of the webpage to the size of the actual screen
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

2) text
    em works better if the user changes the browser text size.


2) A plain, naked, HTML site is perfectly responsive until you change that with CSS

    a) you do not need percentages as most html elements will 
    expand horizontally to fill 100% of the horizontal space. 
    and can use 

    b) use margin and padding to position the element (could be either the same or related)


3)  width
    use max-width to not exceed

4) height 
    use min-height 
    avoid heights, except maybe for headers and footers
    and prefer using margin and padding to add space
    can use height/width 100% to make an inline element fill to parent

5) centering
    use flexbox and not rely on margin auto


5) use flex-wrap and grid's minmax, auto-fill


6) Images
    
    IMG
    use flexible width, height: auto to avoid shrinking on small devices and keep the aspect ratio
    can use "object-fit": fill (stretch), cover, contain

    Background
    background-position: center
    background-size: cover

    images based on client resolution
    <img
    srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,800px"
    src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"   //default or not support srcset
    alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" 
     />

    <img src="swing-400.jpg" 
    sizes="(max-width: 30em) 100vw, (max-width: 50em) 50vw, calc(33vw - 100px)"

Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. 
Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. 
Negative values: ignored.

maximum-scale:
Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. 
Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. 
Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 10. 
Negative values: ignored.

user-scalable: 
Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page.
Valid values: 0(no, against WCAG accessibility)
              1, 
              yes, or no. 

.
interactive-widget: 
Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, 
such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's viewports
resizes-visual: The visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.
resizes-content: The viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.
overlays-content: Neither the viewport nor the visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

minmax() in auto-fill repeating tracks

a grid that contains as many 200 pixel column tracks as will fit into the container 
with the remaining space shared equally between the columns.

In the minmax() function 
the first value is the minimum size I want my tracks to be, 
the second is the maximum. 
By using 1fr as the maximum value the space is equally distributed.

.boxes_wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 10px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr) ) ;
